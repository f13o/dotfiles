# Global Guidelines

- NEVER add docstrings
- NEVER add comments for code sections or steps
- Avoid comments as much as possible, but include them if they explain edge-cases from external systems, or instructions that human gave you explicitly
- NEVER user emojis


**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment. 

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

# Language Specific Guidelines

## Python
- Always suggest pythonic code according to the latest standards
- Prefer "for loops" over nested "list or dict comprehensions", specially when there is conditional logic
- Ternary operator are fine only if conditions are simple
